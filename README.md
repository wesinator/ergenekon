Tracking and timelining historic and ongoing People's Republic of China :cn: malware targeting of Uyghur people

 - Any malware information is categorised and grouped using the horizontal axis of the [Diamond Model](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/summit-archives/cti_summit2014/The_Diamond_Model_for_Intrusion_Analysis_A_Primer_Andy_Pendergast.pdf)
   - Malware file hashes are standardised on SHA256 (where available)

Timeline and list of activity is not exhaustive

The purpose of this project is
1. to document the cyberespionage acitivities of PRC-affiliated adversaries against Uyghur people and organisations
2. to provide easy links to research containing malware observables, tactics and techniques, mitigations, and additional details that may be of value to at-risk or affected people and organisations
